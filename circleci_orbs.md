# Use CircleCI Orbs to Simplify Builds and Improve Efficiency #

Orbs are shareable packages of CircleCI configuration you can use to streamline builds and help automate processes. Using pre-built orbs you can try something new without spending days of engineering time establishing a new system, feature, or DevOps practice. More specifically, an orb is a reusable package of paramaterized YAML configuration that condenses repeated pieces of config into a single line of code, which you can use across multiple similar projects. 

Orbs help you: 
* save time configuring projects.
* increase organizational efficiency.
* simplify third-party integrations.

Thousands of organizations use CircleCI orbs to improve and streamline their processes.

The CircleCI [Orbs Registry](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs) contains an extensive list of orbs ready-made to do things such as: quickly and easily install/configure/use Docker in any CircleCI job, implement Slack event-based notifications across all of your CI/CD pipelines, integrate Amazon AWS S3 with your CircleCI CI/CD pipeline, and much more. 

### Creating your own orbs ###  
If the CircleCI Orb Regsitry doesn't have what you need, you can also create a specialized orb using our [Getting Started](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-author-intro/)  and [Best Practices](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orbs-best-practices/#orb-best-practices-guidelines) guides. In addition, our [Orb Development Kit](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-author/#orb-development-kit) will help you simplify the authoring process with automated testing and deployment on CircleCI. 

If your team wants to share configuration across multiple projects exclusive to your organization, you can also create **private orbs** which are available to all [paid plans.](https://circleci.com/pricing)
