# How CircleCI Orbs Help You Improve Efficiency #

Orbs are shareable packages of CircleCI configuration you can use to simplify your builds and help automate processes.
It simplifies your configuration by allowing you to write a parameterized configuration once and then use it across multiple similar projects. More specifically, an orb is a reusable package of YAML configuration that condenses repeated pieces of config into a single line of code.  

Orbs help you: 
* save time configuring projects.
* increase organizational efficiency.
* simplify third-party integrations.

Thousands of organizations use CircleCI orbs every day to improve and streamline their processes. If you're not already using CircleCI pre-built orbs, check out the [orbs registry](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs), where you can browse CircleCI-authored orbs and those of our many partners and the CircleCI community.

### Creating your own orbs ###  
If the CircleCI Orb Regsitry doesn't have an orb to fit your needs, you can also create a specialized orb using our [Best Practices] (https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orbs-best-practices/#orb-best-practices-guidelines) and [Getting Started] (https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-author-intro/) guides. And our [Orb Development Kit](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-author/#orb-development-kit) will help you simplify the authoring process with automated testing and deployment on CircleCI. 

If your team wants to share configuration across multiple projects, exclusive to your organization, you can create **private orbs**. Private orbs are now available to all [paid plans.] (https://circleci.com/pricing)
